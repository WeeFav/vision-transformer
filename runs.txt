0: original ViT with 0.5 dropout
1: reduce num heads to 6 to reduce model complexity to avoid overfitting
2: original simple ViT for CIFAR10 without data augmentation and batch size of 128
3: add weight decay, 0.5 dropout for regularization
4: add cosine scheduler
5: add AutoAugment and increase epcohs to 1000 to boost diversity
6: reduce lr to 0.005
7: no scheduler, reduce lr to 0.001
8: original simple ViT for CIFAR10
9: increase epoch to 1000
10: add 0.5 dropout
11: 0.1 dropout
12: change to AutoAugment
13: change to orignial augmentation, increase lr to 0.03
14: incrase image size to 224, patch size to 16
15: incrase embedding dimension to 384, epoch to 500
16: same as 15
17: increase hidden dim to 384
18: increase num heads to 12, decrease embedding dim, hidden dim to 48, 192
19: increase embedding dim to 384, increase epoch to 1000, decrease lr to 0.001, decrease batch size to 128
20: decrease num heads to 6 for decrease model complexity, 0.3 dropout for regularization
21: 0.5 dropout
22: 0.1 dropout, change to AutoAugment
